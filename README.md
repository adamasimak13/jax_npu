# Integration and evaluation of JAX framework on NPUs
## Project Goal
 The main goal of this project is to run JAX programs on
 Neural Processing Units (NPUs). JAX is a high
performance machine learning framework from Google. It
 is officially supported on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
 However, the fast-growing field of specialized machine
 learning hardware, especially NPUs, offers a great chance
 for power-efficient and highly accelerated computation.

This project proves the concept that connects JAX's user
friendly API with the low-level, hardware environment of
 NPUs. By doing this, we open up opportunities for the JAX
 ecosystem to take advantage of NPUs for neural network
 inference and training.
